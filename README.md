with) GPLv2. The Nmap license allows free usage by end users, and we also offer
a commercial license for companies that wish to redistribute Nmap technology
with their products. See [Nmap Copyright and Licensing](https://nmap.org/book/man-legal.html)
for full details.

The latest version of this software as well as binary installers for Windows,
macOS, and Linux (RPM) are available from

Questions and suggestions may be sent to the
[Nmap-dev mailing list](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).


Installing
----------
Ideally, you should be able to just type:

    Choose directory
    
    git clone git@github.com:meepmaster360/meepscan.git
    
    cd meepscan
    
    $sudo bash meescan.sh or $chmod +x meepscan.sh and the always $sudo ./meepscan.sh


Using Nmap
----------
Nmap has a lot of features, but getting started is as easy as running `nmap
scanme.nmap.org`. Running `nmap` without any parameters will give a helpful
list of the most common options, which are discussed in depth in [the man
page](https://nmap.org/book/man.html). Users who prefer a graphical interface
can use the included [Zenmap front-end](https://nmap.org/zenmap/).


Using meepscan
----------

    In the correct directory (/meepscan/)
    $sudo bash meepscan.sh
    or
    $chmod +x meepscan.sh (only once)
    $sudo ./meepscan.sh
    #./meepscan.sh (root user)
